In R, everything is a vector, this includes not only sequences of numbers but also text and logical values. This design choice makes R a powerful tool for performing operations across entire datasets at once. In this section, we will explore how to create, manipulate, and understand vectors, as well as how to work with factors, which are special types of vectors used to represent categorical data. Understanding these structures will be foundational to all future data analysis you perform in R.\n\n::: learning-goals\n\n- Distinguish between the basic data types in R, including doubles, characters, and logical values.\n- Create, manipulate, and coerce vectors while understanding how R recycles shorter vectors.\n- Use built-in statistical functions and know how to the basics of index selection.\n- Define and work with factors and ordered factors to represent categorical and ordinal data, including setting and renaming levels.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Supplemental Material\n<a href=\"Reading-Guide/L4-Reading-Guide.pdf\" download>\nðŸ“„ Download the lecture's Reading Guide\n</a>\n:::\n\n## Data Types in R\n\nSo far we have seen how we can create variables in R. It is important to note that all objects in R have a type (the big three are **Doubles**, **Characters**, and **Logical**). A benefit to R is that we do not have to declare each variable and type, as it can figure all of that information out without us needing to do anything. Doubles consist of our numbers, which can be integers or decimal values. This is not the same as *floating point* values in other languages though. We can coerce the value to be an integer by placing an \"L\" after it (but there is no real benefit right now for integers over doubles so don't worry about it). Characters will be anything in quotes, whether it is a single letter, a word, a paragraph, a symbol, or a number. R will treat all characters the same. The last type we should discuss is the Logical type, which consists of TRUE and FALSE (yes it has to be in all caps) or the shortened T and F. If we are ever unsure of the type we are dealing with, we can use the *typeof()* function and R will tell us. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntypeof(17.2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"double\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntypeof(17L)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"integer\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntypeof(17)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"double\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntypeof(\"17\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"character\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntypeof(TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"logical\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt is critical to know what type our value is as it will determine what functions we can use, how we compose expressions, and how we will interpret the results. For instance, we cannot do \"math\" on characters but we can do \"math\" with doubles and logicals (though it might not always make sense to do this).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n\"a\" + \"b\"\n```\n:::\n\n<span style=\"color: red;font-size: 80%; font-family: SFMono-Regular, Consolas, Liberation Mono, Menlo, monospace;\">Error in &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; : non-numeric argument to binary operator</span>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n3 + TRUE # TRUE is equal to 1 and FALSE is equal to 0\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 4\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n\"abc\" + 2\n```\n:::\n\n<span style=\"color: red;font-size: 80%; font-family: SFMono-Regular, Consolas, Liberation Mono, Menlo, monospace;\">Error in &quot;abc&quot; + 2 : non-numeric argument to binary operator</span>\n\nOne thing that makes R different then some other languages is that R is \"vectorized\" (meaning everything is a vector). This characteristic will allow us to quickly work with entire sets of data and avoids the need for iterations or loops (but the *for* and *while* loop still exist). So remember, **Everything is a Vector!!!**\n\n\\begin{watch}{}{}\n    \\href{https://youtu.be/6m-hh-NG0X0}{Data Types in R}\n\\end{watch}\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Try it Out\"}\nEmmit is working at his smoothie stand and tracking sales data.

This will allow us to combine multiple single-element vectors into a multi-element vector. An example of this process can be seen below:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- c(1,2,3,4)\nx\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1 2 3 4\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ny <- c(\"Hello\", \"my name is\", \"Dr. McCurdy\")\ny\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"Hello\"       \"my name is\"  \"Dr. McCurdy\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf we create a vector with multiple types of data in it then it reverts to the \"lowest\" one present (character $<$ double $<$ logical). So, if at least one character is present then all of the elements are turned into characters, and if no characters are present but a double is then all elements turn into doubles. We can see the type a vector is using the *class()* function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- c(1,2,\"3\",4,5) # One character is present\nclass(x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"character\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" \"5\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ny <- c(1, 2, TRUE, 4, 5) # TRUE is turned into a 1\nclass(y)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"numeric\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ny\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1 2 1 4 5\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf we need to explicitly coerce a vector to be a certain type we can (for the most part). It is the nature of vectors to apply functions on every element, so using a function like *as.numeric()* or *as.character()* will try and force all elements to become a certain type.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- as.numeric(c(1,2,\"3\",4,5)) # 3 is coerced into a number\nclass(x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"numeric\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ny <- as.character(c(1,2,3,4,5)) # All items are coerced into characters\nclass(y)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"character\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ny\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" \"5\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\\begin{watch}{}{}\n    \\href{https://youtu.be/vhNnJbHhPzE}{Creating Vectors in R}\n\\end{watch}\n\nWhenever we are dealing with vectors it is important to resist the urge to fight the vector's nature. That is, don't try and overthink it or make it more difficult for yourself, R was meant to handle vectors. **All arithmetic operators can be used on vectors**.

If we compare 2 vectors using logical operators, the result will be a logical vector. There are a few big ones that we will need to know, and they are pretty well known.

All of the functions in this section will require us to pass a vector into it and it will output a vector of the same size or of size 1 or 2. The names for these functions resemble the function name that we would say out loud.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsqrt(182) # square-root of 182\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 13.49074\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- c(2,49,381)\nsqrt(x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1]  1.414214  7.000000 19.519221\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlog(x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.6931472 3.8918203 5.9427994\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere are also functions in R that will do all of the calculations we did in the earlier lectures.

R starts indexing at 1 (this means the first element is index 1, the second element is index 2, and so on) which is different then other languages which start counting at 0. To access specific values we can place the indices in brackets. I will often refer to these as our \"Index-Selection\" brackets.

Another type that we will use quite a bit are **factors**. Factors will allow us to represent categorical data that fit in only a finite number of distinct categories. These factors could either be words (like Small, Medium, or Large) or numbers (like a house having 1, 2, or 3 bedrooms). R does some things behind the scenes to make it efficient to store this qualitative data, but the only thing we really need to know is that if we have categorical data then we should probably save it as a factor using the *factor()* function. \n\nLet's create a vector containing a random sample of \"Males\" and \"Females\" using the *sample()* function. First, we should realize that this is categorical data, so we will want to convert it to a factor. We can then use the *factor()* function to convert it to categories. Notice how the levels are in alphabetical order.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- sample(c(\"Male\", \"Female\"), 7, replace=TRUE)\nx\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"Male\"   \"Female\" \"Male\"   \"Female\" \"Female\" \"Female\" \"Female\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfx <- factor(x)\nfx\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] Male   Female Male   Female Female Female Female\nLevels: Female Male\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can also notice how the vector class and the element type are also altered. We don't have to understand the \"behind-the-scenes\" happenings of why the element type is now an integer. But we should emphasize though that the new vector is no longer a character vector, rather it is a factor since it is categorical data. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclass(x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"character\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclass(fx)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"factor\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntypeof(x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"character\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntypeof(fx)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"integer\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\\begin{watch}{}{}\n    \\href{https://youtu.be/UoPKvEKD9K4}{Creating Factors in R}\n\\end{watch}\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Try it Out\"}\nEmmit is organizing a survey about his favorite fruit stand, and asks his friends what fruit they prefer: \"Apple\", \"Banana\", or \"Cherry\".

To have the levels end up in the correct order, we will want to use the 'levels' argument and pass it a vector of the correct ordering. When you do this, the spelling has to be the same (even the capitalization) for R to recognize it. Now that we have an ordered factor, we can compare values using logical operators.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfy <- factor(y, ordered=TRUE, levels=c(\"Small\", \"Medium\", \"Large\"))\nfy\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] Small  Medium Small  Small  Large  Large  Large \nLevels: Small < Medium < Large\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclass(fy)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"ordered\" \"factor\" \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfy[1] > fy[2]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] FALSE\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAdditionally, we can always see the possible categories an element can have in the factor by using the *levels()* function. Finally, if we wish to change the levels then we can do so by assigning a new character vector to the current levels of factor. Be careful with this, as we do not want to pass in the order of the vector elements, rather we want to pass in the order of the levels.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfy\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] Small  Medium Small  Small  Large  Large  Large \nLevels: Small < Medium < Large\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlevels(fy)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"Small\"  \"Medium\" \"Large\" \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlevels(fy) <- c(\"mini\", \"regular\", \"huge\")\nfy\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] mini    regular mini    mini    huge    huge    huge   \nLevels: mini < regular < huge\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\\begin{watch}{}{}\n    \\href{https://youtu.be/_PfBPa3GQWM}{Dealing with Ordinal Data}\n\\end{watch}\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Try it Out\"}\nEmmit is helping organize a welcome event for new students.

While this is sufficient to run all of our R code, we are going to introduce a program called RStudio. This is the most commonly used IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for R which will allow us to be more organized and better for trouble-shooting our code. It is maintained by Posit and can be downloaded \\href{https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/}{here}. Since you already have R installed, you will only need to download the RStudio Desktop. Once this is done it should look something like this: \n\n![](images/L4-RStudio-Download.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\nWe will run our code in the bottom left panel with the option to save our code in the top left panel using a script or text file (more to come on this in future lectures). In the top right panel we will be able to see the variables saved in our R environment along with a history of our code. In the bottom right panel we will be able to view plots, read documentation, and browse files on our computer.\n\n::: {.practice-it}\n- Create variables in R to do the following:\n  a) Create a variable `age` and assign it your age as a double.  \n  b) Create a variable `student` and assign it a logical value indicating if you are a student (TRUE/FALSE).  \n  c) Create a variable `favorite_food` and assign it your favorite food as a character string.  \n  d) Use the `typeof()` function to check the type of each variable.  \n  e) Combine all three variables into a vector `combined_vec` using `c()` and check its type using `class()`. What do you notice about the elements?\n\n- Create a numeric vector `scores` with values: 82, 90, 75, 88, 95.  \n  a) Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of `scores`.  \n  b) Create a logical vector indicating which scores are above 85.  \n  c) Use this logical vector to subset and display only scores above 85.  \n  d) Multiply all scores by 1.1 to simulate a 10% curve and display the new scores.\n\n- Create a character vector `colors` with values `\"red\"`, `\"blue\"`, `\"green\"`, `\"yellow\"`.  \n  a) Create a logical vector `likes_color` of length 4, with TRUE for `\"blue\"` and `\"green\"` and FALSE otherwise.  \n  b) Use logical indexing to return only the colors you like.  \n  c) Try combining `colors` and `likes_color` into one vector. What happens to the types?\n\n- Create a vector `temps` with the values 72, 75, 78, 80, 77, 74.  \n  a) Access the first, third, and last elements using indexing.  \n  b) Use a logical condition to find and display all temps greater than or equal to 77.  \n  c) Replace the second element with 76 and display the updated vector.\n:::\n\n",
