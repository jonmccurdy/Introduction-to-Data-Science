In R, everything is a vector, this includes not only sequences of numbers but also text and logical values. This design choice makes R a powerful tool for performing operations across entire datasets at once. In this section, we will explore how to create, manipulate, and understand vectors, as well as how to work with factors, which are special types of vectors used to represent categorical data. Understanding these structures will be foundational to all future data analysis you perform in R.\n\n::: learning-goals\n\n- Distinguish between the basic data types in R, including doubles, characters, and logical values.\n- Create, manipulate, and coerce vectors while understanding how R recycles shorter vectors.\n- Use built-in statistical functions and know how to the basics of index selection.\n- Define and work with factors and ordered factors to represent categorical and ordinal data, including setting and renaming levels.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Supplemental Material\n<a href=\"Reading-Guide/L4-Reading-Guide.pdf\" download>\nðŸ“„ Download the lecture's Reading Guide\n</a>\n:::\n\n## Data Types in R\n\nSo far we have seen how we can create variables in R. It is important to note that all objects in R have a type (the big three are **Doubles**, **Characters**, and **Logical**). A benefit to R is that we do not have to declare each variable and type, as it can figure all of that information out without us needing to do anything. Doubles consist of our numbers, which can be integers or decimal values. This is not the same as *floating point* values in other languages though. We can coerce the value to be an integer by placing an \"L\" after it (but there is no real benefit right now for integers over doubles so don't worry about it). Characters will be anything in quotes, whether it is a single letter, a word, a paragraph, a symbol, or a number. R will treat all characters the same. The last type we should discuss is the Logical type, which consists of TRUE and FALSE (yes it has to be in all caps) or the shortened T and F. If we are ever unsure of the type we are dealing with, we can use the *typeof()* function and R will tell us. \n\n```{r}\ntypeof(17.2)\n\ntypeof(17L)\n\ntypeof(17)\n\ntypeof(\"17\")\n\ntypeof(TRUE)\n```\n\nIt is critical to know what type our value is as it will determine what functions we can use, how we compose expressions, and how we will interpret the results. For instance, we cannot do \"math\" on characters but we can do \"math\" with doubles and logicals (though it might not always make sense to do this).\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: FALSE\n\"a\" + \"b\"\n```\n<span style=\"color: red;font-size: 80%; font-family: SFMono-Regular, Consolas, Liberation Mono, Menlo, monospace;\">Error in &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; : non-numeric argument to binary operator</span>\n\n```{r}\n3 + TRUE # TRUE is equal to 1 and FALSE is equal to 0\n```\n\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: FALSE\n\"abc\" + 2\n```\n<span style=\"color: red;font-size: 80%; font-family: SFMono-Regular, Consolas, Liberation Mono, Menlo, monospace;\">Error in &quot;abc&quot; + 2 : non-numeric argument to binary operator</span>\n\nOne thing that makes R different then some other languages is that R is \"vectorized\" (meaning everything is a vector). This characteristic will allow us to quickly work with entire sets of data and avoids the need for iterations or loops (but the *for* and *while* loop still exist). So remember, **Everything is a Vector!!!**\n\n\\begin{watch}{}{}\n    \\href{https://youtu.be/6m-hh-NG0X0}{Data Types in R}\n\\end{watch}\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Try it Out\"}\nEmmit is working at his smoothie stand and tracking sales data. What is the type of each variable and what will he get if he sums up the `protien_added` variable?\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nflavors <- c(\"berry\", \"mango\", \"banana\")\nsales <- c(12, 15, 9)\nprotein_added <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)\nmistake <- c(sales, \"error\")\n```\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/HiZywFMysfU?modestbranding=1&rel=0 >}}\n\n</details>\n:::\n\n## Vectors\n\nTo create a vector containing multiple elements we will use the combine function $c()$. This will allow us to combine multiple single-element vectors into a multi-element vector. An example of this process can be seen below:\n\n```{r}\nx <- c(1,2,3,4)\nx\n\ny <- c(\"Hello\", \"my name is\", \"Dr. McCurdy\")\ny\n```\n\nIf we create a vector with multiple types of data in it then it reverts to the \"lowest\" one present (character $<$ double $<$ logical). So, if at least one character is present then all of the elements are turned into characters, and if no characters are present but a double is then all elements turn into doubles. We can see the type a vector is using the *class()* function.\n\n```{r}\nx <- c(1,2,\"3\",4,5) # One character is present\nclass(x)\n\nx\n\ny <- c(1, 2, TRUE, 4, 5) # TRUE is turned into a 1\nclass(y)\n\ny\n```\n\nIf we need to explicitly coerce a vector to be a certain type we can (for the most part). It is the nature of vectors to apply functions on every element, so using a function like *as.numeric()* or *as.character()* will try and force all elements to become a certain type.\n\n```{r}\nx <- as.numeric(c(1,2,\"3\",4,5)) # 3 is coerced into a number\nclass(x)\n\nx\n\ny <- as.character(c(1,2,3,4,5)) # All items are coerced into characters\nclass(y)\n\ny\n```\n\n\\begin{watch}{}{}\n    \\href{https://youtu.be/vhNnJbHhPzE}{Creating Vectors in R}\n\\end{watch}\n\nWhenever we are dealing with vectors it is important to resist the urge to fight the vector's nature. That is, don't try and overthink it or make it more difficult for yourself, R was meant to handle vectors. **All arithmetic operators can be used on vectors**. It will apply the operation between comparable elements and will \"recycle\" the shorter vector if needed.\n\n```{r}\nx <- c(1,2,3,4,5)\nx\n\nx + 13\n\nx * -2\n\nx <- c(1,2,3)\ny <- c(5,6,7)\n\nx + y\n\nx^y\n\nx <- c(1,2,3,4,5)\ny <- c(1,10,100)\nx + y\n```\n\nWe can also make vectors that are not numeric. These can be both character strings or logical values.\n\n```{r}\nx <- c(\"this\", \"is\", \"a\", \"character vector!\")\nx\n\ny <- \"this is also a character vector!\"\ny\n\nz <- c(T, T, F, F, T, F, T)\nz\n```\n\n\\begin{watch}{}{}\n    \\href{https://youtu.be/L58Xl50txa0}{Doing Math with Vectors}\n\\end{watch}\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Try it Out\"}\nEmmit writes the amount of money he spends on coffee each day for a whole week.

If we compare 2 vectors using logical operators, the result will be a logical vector. There are a few big ones that we will need to know, and they are pretty well known. For instance, $<$ means less than, $>$ means greater than, $<=$ means less than or equal, $>=$ means greater than or equal, $==$ means equal (notice it is two equal signs), and $!=$ means not equal. \n\n```{r}\nx <- c(0, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6)\nx\n\nx == 3 # Checks each element to see if it is equal to 3\n\nx > 4 # Checks each element to see if it is greater than 4\n```\n\n\n\\begin{watch}{}{}\n    \\href{https://youtu.be/IKVtf3-yO3k}{Logical Operators in R}\n\\end{watch}\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Try it Out\"}\nEmmit is training for a marathon and tracks how many miles he runs each day for a week. Using logical vectors determine which days Emmit ran exactly 5 miles, which days he ran more than 4 miles, and which days his total was not equal to 6 miles.\n\nmileage: $6,\\ 5,\\ 6,\\ 2,\\ 4,\\ 12,\\ 5$\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/z-dvXfLzRdc?modestbranding=1&rel=0 >}}\n\n</details>\n:::\n\n## Built-in statistical functions\n\nWithin R, there are also built-in functions that will make our lives easier. All of the functions in this section will require us to pass a vector into it and it will output a vector of the same size or of size 1 or 2. The names for these functions resemble the function name that we would say out loud.\n\n```{r}\nsqrt(182) # square-root of 182\n\nx <- c(2,49,381)\nsqrt(x)\n\nlog(x)\n```\n\nThere are also functions in R that will do all of the calculations we did in the earlier lectures. Unfortunately, there is no function to calculate the mode of a dataset. When working with these functions, it is important to make sure we pass a vector into the functions (this is a common error students make when they start off).\n\n```{r}\nx <- c(12, 10, 18, 11, 11, 15, 21)\n\nsum(x)\nmean(x)\nmedian(x)\nsd(x)\n```\n\nWe can determine how long a vector is using the \\textit{length()} function. We could then use this function along with the sum function to calculate the mean of the dataset:\n\n```{r}\nlength(4)\nlength(c(4,8,2))\n\nlength(x)\nsum(x)/length(x) # Notice this is the mean we found above\n```\n\nIn addition to this, we can calculate the minimum, maximum, and range difference of a vector. We say range difference since the *range()* function provides both the minimum and maximum value, while the *diff()* function gives us the difference between the two values:\n\n```{r}\nx\nsort(x)\nmin(x)\nmax(x)\n\nrange(x)\ndiff(range(x))\n```\n\n\\begin{watch}{}{}\n    \\href{https://youtu.be/pwgSeoNjwPo}{Built-in Functions in R}\n\\end{watch}\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Try it Out\"}\nEmmit recorded the number of minutes he spent reading each day over the last week:\n\nreading time: $20,\\ 35,\\ 28,\\ 40,\\ 30,\\ 35,\\ 45$\n\n- What is the total time Emmit spent reading?\n- What was his average (mean) reading time?\n- What was the median amount of time he read?\n- What is the standard deviation of his reading time?\n- What are the minimum and maximum reading times?

R starts indexing at 1 (this means the first element is index 1, the second element is index 2, and so on) which is different then other languages which start counting at 0. To access specific values we can place the indices in brackets. I will often refer to these as our \"Index-Selection\" brackets. We must pass a vector into our index-selection brackets using the combine function *c()* if we have multiple elements that we want to display.\n\n```{r}\nx\n\nx[2]\n\nx[length(x)]\n\nx[c(1,3,6)]\n```\n\n\n\\begin{watch}{}{}\n    \\href{https://youtu.be/isTXaMdsyfI}{Indexing in R}\n\\end{watch}\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Try it Out\"}\nEmmit is tracking the number of hours he sleeps each night for a week:\n\nsleep time: $6.5,\\ 7,\\ 8,\\ 6,\\ 7.5,\\ 9,\\ 6.5$\n\n- How many hours did Emmit sleep on the second night?\n- How many hours did he sleep on the last night of the week?\n- Use indexing to display only the second, fourth, and sixth nights.\n- Emmit wants to find the average of the sleep hours from the 2nd, 3rd, and 7th nights.\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/OznKgjlzcaw?modestbranding=1&rel=0 >}}\n\n</details>\n:::\n\n\n## Creating Factors in R\n\nSo far we have seen a couple of different types of data in R, including numeric, logical, and character types. Another type that we will use quite a bit are **factors**. Factors will allow us to represent categorical data that fit in only a finite number of distinct categories. These factors could either be words (like Small, Medium, or Large) or numbers (like a house having 1, 2, or 3 bedrooms). R does some things behind the scenes to make it efficient to store this qualitative data, but the only thing we really need to know is that if we have categorical data then we should probably save it as a factor using the *factor()* function. \n\nLet's create a vector containing a random sample of \"Males\" and \"Females\" using the *sample()* function. First, we should realize that this is categorical data, so we will want to convert it to a factor. We can then use the *factor()* function to convert it to categories. Notice how the levels are in alphabetical order.\n\n```{r}\nx <- sample(c(\"Male\", \"Female\"), 7, replace=TRUE)\nx\n\nfx <- factor(x)\nfx\n```\n\nWe can also notice how the vector class and the element type are also altered. We don't have to understand the \"behind-the-scenes\" happenings of why the element type is now an integer. But we should emphasize though that the new vector is no longer a character vector, rather it is a factor since it is categorical data. \n\n```{r}\nclass(x)\nclass(fx)\n\ntypeof(x)\ntypeof(fx)\n```\n\\begin{watch}{}{}\n    \\href{https://youtu.be/UoPKvEKD9K4}{Creating Factors in R}\n\\end{watch}\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Try it Out\"}\nEmmit is organizing a survey about his favorite fruit stand, and asks his friends what fruit they prefer: \"Apple\", \"Banana\", or \"Cherry\". The options are stored in a character vector. Create this character vector in R and then convert it into a factor.\n<details>\n\n<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/nKDoYBoRpeY?modestbranding=1&rel=0 >}}\n\n</details>\n:::\n\n## Dealing with Ordinal Data\n\nIf we remember from our previous lectures, categorical data can fall into two types: Nominal and Ordinal. Right now our *factor()* function is returning the values in a nominal form (meaning the factors have no specific ordering) and thus we cannot compare values. \n\n```{r}\n#| warning: false\n#| eval: false\nfx[1] > fx[2]\n```\n<span style=\"color: red;font-size: 80%; font-family: SFMono-Regular, Consolas, Liberation Mono, Menlo, monospace;\">Warning in Ops.factor(fx[1], fx[2]) : &#39;>&#39; not meaningful for factors</span>\n\n```{r}\n#| warning: false\n#| echo: false\nfx[1] > fx[2]\n```\n\n\nIf we want to create ordinal data in R then all we have to do is specify the 'ordered' argument to be TRUE. An example of this can be seen below, but note that the levels are in alphabetical order by default. \n\n```{r}\ny <- sample(c(\"Small\", \"Medium\", \"Large\"), 7, replace=TRUE)\ny\n\nfy <- factor(y, ordered=TRUE)\nfy\n```\n\nThis is obviously not what we want. When we go to a restaurant and order a side of fries, we expect the Large to be bigger than the Medium which is bigger than the Small. To have the levels end up in the correct order, we will want to use the 'levels' argument and pass it a vector of the correct ordering. When you do this, the spelling has to be the same (even the capitalization) for R to recognize it. Now that we have an ordered factor, we can compare values using logical operators.\n\n```{r}\nfy <- factor(y, ordered=TRUE, levels=c(\"Small\", \"Medium\", \"Large\"))\nfy\n\nclass(fy)\nfy[1] > fy[2]\n```\n\n\nAdditionally, we can always see the possible categories an element can have in the factor by using the *levels()* function. Finally, if we wish to change the levels then we can do so by assigning a new character vector to the current levels of factor. Be careful with this, as we do not want to pass in the order of the vector elements, rather we want to pass in the order of the levels.\n\n```{r}\nfy\nlevels(fy)\n\nlevels(fy) <- c(\"mini\", \"regular\", \"huge\")\nfy\n```\n\n\\begin{watch}{}{}\n    \\href{https://youtu.be/_PfBPa3GQWM}{Dealing with Ordinal Data}\n\\end{watch}\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Try it Out\"}\nEmmit is helping organize a welcome event for new students.

While this is sufficient to run all of our R code, we are going to introduce a program called RStudio. This is the most commonly used IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for R which will allow us to be more organized and better for trouble-shooting our code. It is maintained by Posit and can be downloaded \\href{https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/}{here}. Since you already have R installed, you will only need to download the RStudio Desktop. Once this is done it should look something like this: \n\n![](images/L4-RStudio-Download.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\nWe will run our code in the bottom left panel with the option to save our code in the top left panel using a script or text file (more to come on this in future lectures). In the top right panel we will be able to see the variables saved in our R environment along with a history of our code. In the bottom right panel we will be able to view plots, read documentation, and browse files on our computer.\n\n::: {.practice-it}\n- Create variables in R to do the following:\n  a) Create a variable `age` and assign it your age as a double.  \n  b) Create a variable `student` and assign it a logical value indicating if you are a student (TRUE/FALSE).  \n  c) Create a variable `favorite_food` and assign it your favorite food as a character string.  \n  d) Use the `typeof()` function to check the type of each variable.  \n  e) Combine all three variables into a vector `combined_vec` using `c()` and check its type using `class()`.

What happens to the types?\n\n- Create a vector `temps` with the values 72, 75, 78, 80, 77, 74.  \n  a) Access the first, third, and last elements using indexing.  \n  b) Use a logical condition to
